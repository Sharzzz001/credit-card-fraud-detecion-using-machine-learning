# credit-card-fraud-detecion-using-machine-learning

Dataset
The dataset of of nearly 28,500 credit card transactions was used to identify transactions with a high probability of being credit card fraud. The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle

This project uses various ML algorithms to detect credit card fraud detection.

Method of Coding:
Data Analysis,
Data Cleaning,
KNN,
Random Forest,
Logistic Regression,
K-Neighbors,
ROC and AUC curve.

Also the sensitivity, precision and accuracy rate of each of the methods is also calculated.

Happy Coding!
