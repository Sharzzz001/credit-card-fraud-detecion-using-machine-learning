# credit-card-fraud-detecion-using-machine-learning

Hey its yo boi sharzzz, droppin off my first project on git

This project uses various ML algorithms to detect credit card fraud detection.

Method of Coding:
Data Analysis
Data Cleaning
KNN
Random Forest
Logistic Regression
K-Neighbors
ROC and AUC curve

Also the sensitivity, precision and accuracy rate of each of the methods is also calculated.

Happy Coding!
